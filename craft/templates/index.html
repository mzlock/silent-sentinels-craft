			<p>The Silent Sentinels were a group of women in favor of women's suffrage organized by <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=alice+paul">Alice Paul</a> and the National Woman's Party. They protested in front of the White House during Woodrow Wilson's presidency starting
				on January 10, 1917. The women protested for six days a week until June 4, 1919 when the Nineteenth Amendment to the
				United States Constitution was passed both by the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>
