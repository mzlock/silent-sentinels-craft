      <p>The Silent Sentinels were 72 women who picketed, protested, and even went to prison, whatever it took to get women the
        right to vote. Taunts, beatings, and torure did not deter them.</p>
      <p>Help us build a museum to honor these brave women. We can make sure the sentinels are silent no longer.</p>

        <p>The Silent Sentinels were a group of women in favor of women's suffrage organized by 
          <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=alice+paul">Alice Paul</a> 
          and the National Woman's Party. They protested in front of the White House during Woodrow Wilson's presidency starting
          on January 10, 1917. The women protested for six days a week until June 4, 1919 when the Nineteenth Amendment to
          the United States Constitution was passed both by the House of Representatives and the Senate.
